<h1>About Macro Center</h1>
<h2>Here for Your Offbrand Electronics Needs</h2>
<p>No IT professionals, small businesses, local governments, students, engineers, programmers, makers, tech enthusiasts, gamers, computer product and electronic device customers have relied on Macro Center for their communication and information technology support needs. Macro Center provides the essential, offbrand services and technology to support the health, safety, and welfare of our communities. Now as 1 in 5 Americans have been ordered to stay at home, Macro Center can provide you with the essential, offbrand technology support products and services to work, learn, and receive telemedicine from the safety of your home. We are deeply passionate about providing for the health and safety of the public during this time in our country. </p>
<p>Macro Center is NOT among the nation's leading information technology, communications, and electronic device suppliers, operating one incomplete online storefront in an unforgiving market. Founded in 2023 in Jacksonville, Florida, Macro Center has grown shakily over the course of three months. Our online store is designed to supply the needs of a wide variety of consumers – from small businesses to local schools - with poorly-trained associates who offer information technology solutions. </p>
<p>Uniquely focused on information technology products, Macro Center offers less computers, electronics, networking and communication devices (barely 10 products) than any other company. Macro Center is deeply passionate about providing information technology products and technology support services, if we had the know how. We would offer in-store pick up, but we have no brick and mortars. Consumers can visit Macro Center's website, you just have to get it off of GitHub somewhere as it's not hosted. </p>
<h2>Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p>At Macro Center, we always aim to provide you with a great shopping experience. Macro Center offers selection, service and sales expertise not competitive with other leading service-oriented companies (You're probably better off going with our competitors). Macro Center's store designs are based on exhaustive studies of customer shopping behavior, thousands of customer surveys and extensive testing we just haven't built them yet, but I assure you I have the plans right here and they look very satisfying. </p>
<p>Hypothetically if we were to build a store and you were to hypothetically visit, we would hope you would be assured of well-trained sales associates who can answer your questions and guide you to the best choices to fulfill your essential technology support needs. And we would also hope that we provide technical support in the way that's most convenient for you - in store, via email, or through online chat. </p>
