@*  This is a partial view that helps reduce the duplication of the same markup across multiple Razor views, like a template.
    These should only contain HTML and Razor directives, and they get their model data from the parent view.
    Accessing data directly in a partial view breaks the separation of concerns that is MVC. Data retrieval and
    processing logic should not be in the same view file.*@
@model Product
<div class="card m-3 rounded">
    <div class="card-block m-2">
        <h3>
            <strong>@Model.Name</strong>
            <span class="float-right bg-success text-white rounded m-2 p-1">
                @Model.Price.ToString("c")
            </span>
